# Zach's Blog - GitHub Page
[Zach's Blog](https://blog.zakkaru.xyz) uses GitHub Pages to generate a static site with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). This repository was originally created by cloning and following the [GitHub Pages Tutorial](https://github.com/skills/github-pages). I have added portions of the Jekyll theme [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima), so that I am able to customize the layout to my liking. I prefer plain, straightforward webpages.
