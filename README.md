# Zach's Blog - GitHub Page
[Zach's Blog](https://www.zakkaru.xyz) uses GitHub Pages to generate a static site with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). This repository was originally created by cloning and following the [GitHub Pages Tutorial](https://github.com/skills/github-pages). I have added portions of the Jekyll theme [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima), so that I am able to customize the layout to my liking. I prefer plain, straightforward (minima ðŸ˜‰) webpages. I have imported my [original blog posts](https://zakkaru.wordpress.com) using [wpXml2Jekyll](https://github.com/theaob/wpXml2Jekyll) and manually updating the image links in the source.
