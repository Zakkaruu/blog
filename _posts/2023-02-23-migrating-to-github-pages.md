title: "Migrating to GitHub Pages"

This is a quick update to let you know Iâ€™ll be moving my blog to GitHub pages. The reasoning is that I do not need the paid WordPress features to provide the content I currently offer. The migration will break existing links. I will be migrating all of the posts, so no content will be lost.

You can see the base site here: [https://zakkaruu.github.io/blog/](https://zakkaruu.github.io/blog/)

It will initially be available at [https://www.zakkaru.xyz/](https://www.zakkaru.xyz/) (live now), but I will repurpose the [blog.zakkaru.xyz](blog.zakkaru.xyz) in the future (possibly 2 weeks or so).
