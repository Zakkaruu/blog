<h2>Introduction</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"dropCap":true} -->
<p class="has-drop-cap">When I first arrived to the district, I was told that <strong>network performance takes a huge hit during testing</strong>. The theory was there were simply <strong><em>too</em> </strong>many users connected at the same time. Many discussions with staff advised them to stagger testing periods to alleviate the issue. This never happened.</p>

<h2>Discovery</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Months in, I was auditing network configurations. Going through all of the interfaces, VLANs<sup>4</sup>, LLDP<sup>5</sup>, and more. I wanted to become more familiar with the network and gain a better understanding. Shortly after, I realized what the problem was: <strong>site-wide broadcast</strong> <strong>traffic</strong><sup>6</sup><strong>.</strong> </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wireless VLANs were served from our distribution switch to an entire site. Using Wireshark, I viewed traffic during a normal, non-test day and it was excessive. Most staff used wireless for laptops and phones, with very few using a hard wired connection. Interestingly enough, all other VLANs were broken down by building(wired, VoIP<sup>7</sup>, etc)--leaving only the wireless VLANs spanning the entire site.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each site had <strong>three VLANs</strong> that handled wireless traffic spanning the entire site, one VLAN per SSID<sup>8</sup>/subnet<sup>9</sup>. Broadcast traffic would flood the entire site from any client at any building. During testing periods, there could be <strong>over 100 students on their laptops</strong>. This is in addition to printers, casting devices, and more that already use the wireless.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There were a couple options that I considered. Implement some kind of <strong>broadcast reduction</strong> using the wireless controller, or <strong>network segmentation</strong><sup>10</sup>. Using segmentation, I could setup more control and customization over the network moving forward (<em>ACLs/QoS/etc</em>).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>This project quickly became more than I expected</strong>. It was my <em>first </em>major project, and I intended to <em>get it right the first time</em>. By breaking up the site-wide VLANs, I now needed <strong>3 VLANs and DHCP</strong><sup>11</sup><strong> scopes per building</strong>. This <strong>more than doubled </strong>the amount of DHCP scopes already in use. Luckily, PowerShell<sup>12</sup> made this process easy using a script.</p>

<!-- /wp:code -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I decided to use /23 networks instead of the previous /21s. <em>"But Zach, I thought you wanted to make the broadcast domains<sup>13</sup> smaller?"</em> I did, but I am also lazy and wanted to leave room for pre-planned growth. By choosing a /23 for each new network, I can pair them down as needed. Since this address space has never been in use, I took the easy route. üëç</p>

<h2>Deployment</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During the week of deployment, I preloaded all new configurations and verified connectivity during the day. Configuration involved addressing<sup>14</sup>, helper addresses<sup>15</sup>, OSPF<sup>16</sup> inclusion, etc. A co-worker and I planned to deploy this within <strong>2-3 hours</strong> at the end of a Friday.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There were some hurdles the night of deployment. We wanted to standardize the server IP design across sites, in addition to the wireless changes. That caused some other issues. Implementing the new VLANs was a matter of moving APs into groups based on closet within the wireless controller<sup>17</sup>. Logic in the controller was then used to put each SSID into the proper VLAN.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Due to the other unplanned issues with server changes, it took about 3x longer to get everything running smoothly. <em>We were still able to get it done in a single night <strong>thankfully</strong></em>.</p>

<h2>Day One</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the following day, there were a few bumps. The RADIUS<sup>18</sup> servers were not properly setup in the controller, leaving staff unable to connect to the Instruction network--the primary SSID in use. We were hung up on this the previous night, so there was some familiarity. Long story short, we didn't point each site to their specific RADIUS server. We were able to resolve the issue prior to the start of classes. Following that, everything ran smooth.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A large driving factor for this project was students returning to the classroom from distance learning. I figured with their return, they would be on their devices more than ever--and that has definitely been the case.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The next round of testing arrived at each of the sites, and all of us in the tech department almost forgot. We didn't hear any complaints about the network being slow, being dropped, or anything really. The project was a <em>quiet </em>success, but it felt great knowing that technology would not get in the way of testing any longer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An added bonus was that we could now see and track which building someone was in. IPs now give insights into locations and tracking down devices could be done by searching the scopes and coordinating it with the MAC<sup>19</sup> tables. (Search for the MAC at the distribution switch<sup>20</sup> down to the access switch<sup>21</sup>).</p>

<h2>To Readers</h2>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This was my <em>first</em> <em>actual tech blog</em>. There is probably a lot to be desired, so I invite anyone reading to provide feedback. One thing I think could add a lot would be more images, but I wasn't quite sure what exactly. I'm open to go back, add more, and edit; so let me know. üòÉ</p>
